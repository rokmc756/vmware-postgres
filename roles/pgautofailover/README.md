## What is pg_auto_failover?
- Facilitates the creation of a High Availability (HA) configuration
- Monitors replication between Postgres instances
- Manages automatic failover for a group of Postgres nodes.
- Optimizes for simplicity and correctness.
- Guarantees availability for business continuity of the Postgres service to users and applications with asynchronous replication in the event of a standby node failure while automating maintenance operations as a trade-off involved.
- Configuration changes in a live system without downtime.

## Main Components of pg_auto_failover cluster for VMware Postgres
### Requires three key components as a minimum:
- a pg_auto_failover monitor node as a witness and an orchestrator.
- a Postgres primary node.
- a Postgres secondary node, using by default a synchronous hot standby setup.
### Consists of the following parts:
- a PostgreSQL extension named pgautofailover
- a PostgreSQL service to operate the pg_auto_failover monitor
- a pg_auto_failover keeper to operate your PostgreSQL instances

## The architecture of pg_auto_failover cluster
### Single Standby node
![alt text](https://github.com/rokmc756/postgres-cluster/blob/main/roles/pgfailover-postgres/images/arch-single-standby.svg)
- Monitor node implements a state machine and relies on in-core PostgreSQL facilities to deliver HA.
- For example. when the secondary node is detected to be unavailable or when its lag is too much, then the Monitor removes it from the synchronous_standby_names setting on the primary node.
- Until the secondary is back to being monitored healthy, failover and switchover operations are not allowed, preventing data loss.

### Multi Standby nodes
![alt text](https://github.com/rokmc756/postgres-cluster/blob/main/roles/pgfailover-postgres/images/arch-multi-standby.svg)
- Even after losing any Postgres node, this architecture maintains two copies of the data on two different nodes.
- When using more than one standby, different architectures can be achieved with pg_auto_failover, depending on the objectives and trade-offs needed for your setup.

### Three Standby nodes
![alt text](https://github.com/rokmc756/postgres-cluster/blob/main/roles/pgfailover-postgres/images/arch-three-standby-one-async.svg)
- Two standby nodes participating in the replication quorum, allowing for number_sync_standbys = 1.
- A minimum of two copies of the data set: one on the primary, another one on one on either node B or node D.
- Guarantee two copies of the data set whenever losing one of those nodes.
- Standby server C will not participate in the replication quorum.
- Node C will not be found in the synchronous_standby_names list of nodes.
- Node C will never be a candidate for failover, with candidate-priority = 0.
- Fit a situation where nodes A, B, and D are deployed in the same data center or availability zone, and node C in another.
- Support the main production traffic and implement high availability of both the Postgres service and the data set.
- Node C might be set up for Business Continuity in case the first data center is lost, or maybe for reporting the need for deployment on another application domain.
